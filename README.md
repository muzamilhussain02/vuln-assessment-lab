"Hands-on Vulnerability Assessment Lab using OpenVAS, Metasploit, and Metasploitable2. Ethical hacking practice and exploitation notes."

# Vulnerability Assessment Lab 🚨

This repository documents my hands-on journey in Vulnerability Assessment and Exploitation using:

- 🛠️ OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager)
- 🎯 Metasploit Framework
- 💻 Metasploitable2 VM
- 🔧 Nmap and other tools

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- Identify vulnerable ports and services
- Exploit legacy protocols like `rlogin` and `rexec`
- Learn to document security findings
- Improve ethical hacking and assessment skills

---

## 🧪 Explored Vulnerabilities

### 1. rlogin (Port 513)
- Weak authentication (passwordless root access)
- Successfully logged in as `root` without password

### 2. rexec (Port 512)
- Remote command execution vulnerability
- Identified using OpenVAS and attempted exploitation with Metasploit modules

### 3. ingreslock (Port 1524)
- Service observed to be listening earlier, investigating potential abuse

> More vulnerabilities to be added as the lab expands.
